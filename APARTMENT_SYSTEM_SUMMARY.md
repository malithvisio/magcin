# Apartment-Based Multi-Tenant System - Implementation Summary

## 🏢 System Overview

Your travel company now has a complete apartment-based multi-tenant architecture where:

- **Each apartment has one root user** who owns all data
- **Multiple member users** can work under each root user
- **Complete data isolation** between apartments
- **All data references the root user** for proper filtering

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. Enhanced User Model (`models/User.ts`)

**Key Features:**

- `isRootUser`: Boolean flag to identify apartment owners
- `rootUserId`: References the apartment owner (for members)
- `apartmentName` & `apartmentDescription`: Apartment details
- `role`: `root_user`, `admin`, `member`, `super_admin`
- Usage tracking only for root users
- Subscription management only for root users

**New Methods:**

```typescript
// Get effective root user ID (self if root user, otherwise parent)
user.getEffectiveRootUserId();

// Check apartment access
user.hasApartmentAccess(targetRootUserId);

// Find root users by company
User.findRootUsersByCompany(companyId);

// Find members by root user
User.findMembersByRootUser(rootUserId);
```

### 2. Updated Settings Model (`models/Settings.ts`)

**Added Multi-Tenant Fields:**

- `rootUserId`: References apartment owner
- `companyId` & `tenantId`: Multi-tenant isolation
- Proper indexing for apartment-based queries

### 3. Apartment Utilities (`util/apartment-utils.ts`)

**Core Functions:**

```typescript
// Get apartment context from request
getApartmentContext(req);

// Get database filter for apartment data
getApartmentDataFilter(context);

// Check permissions
canPerformAction(context, 'create_package');

// Update usage stats
updateRootUserUsage(rootUserId, 'packages', true);
```

## 🔐 Permission System

### Role-Based Permissions

| Action                  | Root User | Admin | Member |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ |
| Create/Edit/Delete Data | ✅        | ✅    | ❌     |
| View Data               | ✅        | ✅    | ✅     |
| Manage Members          | ✅        | ❌    | ❌     |
| View Analytics          | ✅        | ❌    | ❌     |
| Manage Subscription     | ✅        | ❌    | ❌     |

### Action Types

- `create_package`, `edit_package`, `delete_package`
- `create_destination`, `edit_destination`, `delete_destination`
- `create_blog`, `edit_blog`, `delete_blog`
- `create_team_member`, `edit_team_member`, `delete_team_member`
- `create_activity`, `edit_activity`, `delete_activity`
- `create_testimonial`, `edit_testimonial`, `delete_testimonial`
- `manage_settings`, `view_analytics`, `manage_members`

## 📊 Data Isolation

### All Models Include:

```typescript
{
  rootUserId: ObjectId,  // References apartment owner
  companyId: String,      // Company identifier
  tenantId: String,       // Tenant identifier
}
```

### Database Queries:

```typescript
// Get apartment data
const packages = await Package.find({
  rootUserId: apartmentContext.rootUserId,
  companyId: apartmentContext.companyId,
  tenantId: apartmentContext.tenantId,
});

// Create with apartment context
const newPackage = new Package({
  ...data,
  rootUserId: apartmentContext.rootUserId,
  companyId: apartmentContext.companyId,
  tenantId: apartmentContext.tenantId,
});
```

## 🚀 API Implementation

### Example API Route (`app/api/packages/apartment-example/route.ts`)

**GET Request:**

```typescript
export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const apartmentContext = await getApartmentContext(req);
  const apartmentFilter = getApartmentDataFilter(apartmentContext);

  const packages = await Package.find(apartmentFilter);
  return NextResponse.json({ data: packages });
}
```

**POST Request:**

```typescript
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const apartmentContext = await getApartmentContext(req);

  if (!canPerformAction(apartmentContext, 'create_package')) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 });
  }

  const newPackage = new Package({
    ...data,
    rootUserId: apartmentContext.rootUserId,
    companyId: apartmentContext.companyId,
    tenantId: apartmentContext.tenantId,
  });
}
```

## 🔄 Migration Tools

### Migration Script (`scripts/migrate-to-apartment-structure.js`)

**Commands:**

```bash
# Migrate existing data
node scripts/migrate-to-apartment-structure.js migrate

# Create new apartment
node scripts/migrate-to-apartment-structure.js create-apartment "Apartment Name" "email@example.com" "password" "company1" "tenant1"

# Add member to apartment
node scripts/migrate-to-apartment-structure.js add-member "rootUserId" "Member Name" "member@example.com" "password"

# Get apartment statistics
node scripts/migrate-to-apartment-structure.js stats "rootUserId"

# List all apartments
node scripts/migrate-to-apartment-structure.js list
```

## 📈 Usage Tracking

```typescript
{
  packages: 0,
  destinations: 0,

  testimonials: 0,
}
```

const packages = await Package.find(apartmentFilter);
const destinations = await Destination.find(apartmentFilter);
const blogs = await Blog.find(apartmentFilter);
```
